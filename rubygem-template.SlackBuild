# This template is not meant to be a 'cut and paste' script to
# enable any random user to make a working package.  While
# we're certainly not discouraging use of this template, if
# you haven't manually gone through each step of the process
# without the build script (typically as a normal user, as this
# will reveal problems that you won't see as root), then there's
# a good chance that something important is missing from your
# submission.

# When using this template script, please remove as many of
# these unnecessary comments as possible.  Commented code is
# a good thing, but if it's obvious, there's no need to comment it.
#
# AGAIN, REMOVE THE COMMENTS IF THEY ARE NOT NEEDED - DON'T JUST
# DELETE THIS BLOCK OF TEXT WITHOUT BOTHERING TO READ WHAT'S IN IT.
